## 🛠️ How It Works

The game picks a random number between 1 and 20. Your goal is to guess it by typing a number. The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low. Once you guess it right, you can play again and try to beat your highscore! 🎉

## 📝 Rules

1. **Start Each Game**: You begin with a score of **20** at the start of each game.
2. **Incorrect Guesses**: Each wrong guess will make you lose **1 point** from your score. ❌
3. **Correct Guess**: When you guess the correct number, the game ends with the remaining score (e.g., if you guessed wrong 4 times, your score will be 16).
4. **Highscore Tracking**: After the game ends, your final score is compared with your **highscore**. If it’s higher, it will become your new highscore. 🏆
5. **Reset and Replay**: You can reset the game at any time by clicking the reset button and try to beat your highscore. 🎯🏆
